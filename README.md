Game Stack is designed for growth and host more Javascript games in the future with an idea of it to be a single page application that operates only on its root page and implementing all of the logic and changes with Javascript.

As of right now Game Stack hosting two games:

![game stack welcome screen](/app/assets/images/trivia.png?raw=true "Title")

Trivia - a game where the you are being asked questions about interesting but unimportant facts in many subjects. With every correct answer you receive a 100 points. When you answer incorrectly you'll be shown a correct answer and total score for the game, After that you will be offered to post your score on the scoreboard with you name and/or start a new game.

![game stack welcome screen](/app/assets/images/dot.png?raw=true "Title")

Flappy Dot - is my interpretation for famously known "Flappy Bird" game. Flappy Dot is build on html 5 canvas element. The is trying to fight the gravity rule by staying up in the air and avoiding pipes (use space on laptops or touch the screen on mobile devices). Your score is incrementing by 1 every second with an idea of longer you stay in the air without collision, more point you get.
